# Planning

## Defining the Problem

My client, Mr. Saurav Adhikari, is my younger cousin currently in grade 7. Over the summer holidays, he developed an interest in the game PUBG, which we often played together for entertainment. However, once he returned home, he needed an offline game similar to PUBG. He was not satisfied with the existing offline games I recommended. As I was also brainstorming for my Computer Science IA at the time, I decided to develop an offline FPS game for him.

## Rationale for the Proposed Solution

To solve this problem, I decided to use Unity 3D to design and develop an FPS game that could be played offline, based on Mr. Adhikari's requirements. I chose Unity 3D as the game development engine for the following reasons:

- Unity 3D is user-friendly, easy to debug, and versatile in design.
- A plethora of tutorials are available to guide developers throughout the game development process.
- Unity 3D supports JavaScript and C#, the scripting languages I am  familiar with.
- The Unity Asset Store provides all the resources required for game development, such as characters, buildings, and more.
- Unity allows developers to create full version games at no cost.
- Unity supports cross-platform development, meaning a single script can be compiled and used across various platforms.

## Success Criteria

The game will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria:

1. The game operates in first-person mode.
2. The player can pause the game, as it is intended to be played offline.
3. A Help Menu is available to inform the player about the control keys.
4. The player can use a gun to eliminate enemies.
5. The player can use a Gun-Scope while shooting.
6. Enemies attack the player when they are in close proximity.
7. The player's score increases when they successfully shoot an enemy.
8. The game ends when the player is killed by enemies or when the time runs out.
