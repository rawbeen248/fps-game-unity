## Client Feedback
The client was satisfied with the game as all his requirements (success criteria) were achieved. He was amazed when he saw Dharahara (historical monument of Nepal) in the game. I added a mini-map on the game as he suggested me to do so after doing User-Acceptance Testing. In overall, the feedbacks and problems are stated below:
1.	It takes more than 10 seconds to load the Game Scene from the Main Menu Scene. 
2.	Sometime enemy attacks through the wall.
3.	He has suggested me to add ‘Save Game’ and ‘Load Game’ option so that he can save the game and later play from the point he left last time.   
4.	He has also suggested me to add ‘Revive’ button in the Pause Scene so that he can restart the game whenever he wants without again going to the Main Menu.

## Recommendation for further development

Though all the success criteria are achieved, there are still a lot of improvement options that could be done to make the game more interesting and systematic. Some of them are:
1.	Addition of High Score Table
A High Score Table can be added to the game where top 10 high scores with the Player’s name can be saved. This can be done by using MySQL Database Management System and building connection between Unity 3D and MySQL.
2.	‘Save Game’ and ‘Load Game’ option
‘Save Game’ and ‘Load Game’ options can be added to the game so that the players can save the game at any point and later play from the same point by loading the saved game. PlayerPrefs can be used to save the game locally on the player’s device.
3.	Shooter Enemies
To make this game more complicated and interesting, enemies with gun who can shoot the player from far distance can be added. This can be done by just modifying few lines of code of the enemies that already exists in the game.
